    <h2><i>From What We Were And What We R Now... </i></h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        So Starting From me... 
        <hr>
        When I first paid attention to u then realize that u r kind of mine a far more days back when swap came.... this realization occurs... But somewhere i know that the kind of reputation or u can say a pre assumption of my character in between girls is not so good either coz of Isha or some other activity or whatever.

        <hr>
        So the conclusion of this i couldn't have that much guts to say this that u r having a same vibe like of me.... and more

        but nature want something interesting.... then Swapnil came and more things happen. Lastly at the end of 11th i decided to start a conversation and texts u some shit i really don't remember 
        but ya it was about some status of whatsapp.
       Ya.. eventually not so good but some good conversation happen 
       then a non forgettable conference call happen ... this might be enough for u to realize or remember that day if not then read next.... 
       
       I think the very first call of mine with u and the very first call in conference with KP,SWAP and none other than the cute one ME <i><b> Don't Laugh...</b></i> 
       <hr>
       That call changes a lot u r now our official member and then we stated a little bigger conversation 

       I really don't know when These conversation are becoming really big and I shared a lot with u about me Swap Hrithik Kp and many more
       How and when u become my one of the most reliable person and the one on whom i can trust more than my friends or anyone ever exits.
       then we play T or D a lot of times to elaborate ourself and make ourself more comfortable with each other. I literally told u everything that i never thought it will be anywhere listen by anyone
        but ya i was too confident that it was then also with me coz u r one whom i can trust that they r like a secret thing and u will keep them like Yourself.
        And then 12th over and a tragic swings happen u did a thing which was necessary for u and for ur future 
        u proposed Swapnil... <b><i><h4>HOLD ON </h4></i></b> Don't think anything just read ahead
        <hr>
        Whatever happen just forget that this is our story so further moving on. I became urs backbone ur brother ur caretaker ur problem solver BLAH BLAH BLAH
        I Don't know and i still don't know how that all happen But Ya I found you as my forever in whatever form and ya forever i will be there for u in every cause of urs 

        <hr>
        What is going in ur mind knowing very well but keep that aside just tell me how u r that much comfortable with me.. obviously you won't tell me or do not want to think about that.. it's ok i respect that but kabhi man kre to bata dena. 

         You know kabhi kabhi apne pe hasi ati hai being someones last choice i became someones first 
        Whatever the time i spend with u was tremendous,fabulous whether it was our first ever meet after school at nauka vihar 
        <i>NOT REMEMBER</i>

        <hr>
        At Ur house When u need someone at ur worst then i was there with my strong shoulder and caretaker mindset.
        when u introduced me as ur Friend and we saw a movie and i gifted u a pendent that u loved a lot,might be it was with u now or u lost that somewhere. 
        And many more meetings that was unforgettable for me and obviously for u too.
        And many more Vc's that held between us,Many T or D's,etc.
